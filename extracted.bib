  abstract =      {The distribution system provides major opportunities
                   for smart grid concepts. One way to approach
                   distribution system problems is to rethinking our
                   distribution system to include the integration of
                   high levels of distributed energy resources, using
                   microgrid concepts. Basic objectives are improved
                   reliability, promote high penetration of renewable
                   sources, dynamic islanding, and improved generation
                   efficiencies through the use of waste heat. Managing
                   significant levels of distributed energy resources
                   (DERs) with a wide and dynamic set of resources and
                   control points can become overwhelming. The best way
                   to manage such a system is to break the distribution
                   system down into small clusters or microgrids, with
                   distributed optimizing controls coordinating
                   multimicrogrids. The Consortium for Electric
                   Reliability Technology Solutions (CERTSs) concept
                   views clustered generation and associated loads as a
                   grid resource or a
                   {\&}{\#}x201C;microgrid.{\&}{\#}x201D; The clustered
                   sources and loads can operate in parallel to the grid
                   or as an island. This grid resource can disconnect
                   from the utility during events (i.e., faults, voltage
                   collapses), but may also intentionally disconnect
                   when the quality of power from the grid falls below
                   certain standards. This paper focuses on DER-based
                   distribution, the basics of microgrids, possibility
                   of smart distribution systems using coupled microgrid
                   and the current state of autonomous microgrid

  abstract =      {The nonlinear induction motor model is appropriately
                   integrated by incorporating the dynamics of the power
                   electronic converter in a manner that permits the
                   design of stable field-oriented control (FOC)
                   operating with minimum losses. As already proven, the
                   challenging issue of operating the induction machine
                   with minimum copper losses requires a varying rotor
                   flux opposed to the standard FOC technique, which
                   keeps the rotor field magnitude constant and tracks
                   the electric torque to the desired level. To this
                   end, exploiting the Hamiltonian structure of the
                   developed motor/converter model, an innovated
                   nonlinear controller is proposed that guarantees the
                   technical limits of the converter (linear modulation)
                   and simultaneously operates under FOC at steady state
                   to achieve accurate speed regulation with varying
                   rotor flux according to the minimal losses
                   requirements. Under these circumstances, the
                   conventional FOC stability analysis does not hold
                   anymore, and therefore for the first time, a new
                   rigorous analysis is provided that proves stability
                   and convergence to the desired equilibrium for the
                   complete closed-loop motor converter system. Finally,
                   the theoretical contribution is examined in
                   comparison to the traditional FOC operation by
                   simulations obtained for an industrial size induction
                   motor, while it is further evaluated by real-time
                   results of a motor with similar parameters.},

                   frequency converter is conducted. To this end, a
                   nonlinear modeling of the entire system is used in a
                   manner that permits a novel controller design with
                   common structure for both the generator- and
                   grid-side converters. The proposed controller, acting
                   directly on the duty-ratio inputs of the converters,
                   ensures the boundedness of the duty-ratio signals in
                   the permitted range although its structure is
                   independent from the system parameters and open to
                   different control objectives. Therefore, maximum
                   power point tracking and power factor correction are
                   easily implemented. Furthermore, the controller is
                   proven to guarantee stability of the whole system
                   under field- or near-field-oriented conditions
                   without needing any flux measurement or estimation.
                   Hence, the main contribution established by this
                   approach is that a rigorous stability analysis taking
                   into account the generator, converters, dc link, and
                   controller dynamics is presented on the basis of a
                   complete system modeling and controller design
                   approach. The theoretical analysis and controller
                   effectiveness are confirmed via extended simulation
                   results for a commercial size 2-MW induction
                   generator operating under varied wind speed
                   conditions and are further validated on a similar
                   system with real-time results.},

                   switching power converters using the Hamil-tonian
                   approach. Abstract In this paper we show how, using
                   the Hamiltonian formalism, we can systematically
                   derive mathematical models that describe the
                   behaviour of a large class of switching power

                   We follow the approach proposed by van der Schaft and
                   Maschke and extract from the basic
                   (energy-conserving) LC—circuit the remaining

                   transformers, which we treat as external ports. This
                   method naturally yields a Hamiltonian system with two
                   additional conjugated sets of port variables. This
                   procedure, besides being systematic and very general,
                   has the additional advantage of resulting in

                   microgrid, composed by a solar panel, an energy
                   storage system, a utility grid and a group of
                   interconnected loads, such as housing-office
                   equipment and electrical vehicles. The transmission
                   lines connect the energy sources with the loads
                   through the corresponding switching DC/DC converters.
                   The novelty resides in the port-Hamiltonian
                   formulations developed for the physical model which
                   is first described through a Bond Graph. An extended
                   architecture of the system with a meshed topology is
                   presented. The proposed architecture has the ability
                   to reduce the power losses within the DC microgrid
                   system by increasing the different transmission line
                   paths among the sources and the loads. The global
                   dynamical model of the system is finally converted
                   into a state-space representation. Furthermore, in
                   view of system control and optimization we formulate
                   the load balancing problem of the DC microgrid in
                   order to stabilize the power flow within the DC bus.

                   degradation in batteries used for power system
                   applications. Unlike conventional battery control
                   methods that try to extend battery lifetime by
                   applying heuristic rules, this approach allows us to
                   maximize battery lifetime within an optimal control
                   framework. We use an online Least Squares (LS)
                   identification method to develop a two-dimensional
                   degradation map that describes the lost battery
                   charge as a function of the battery state of charge
                   and the applied current. We project the degradation
                   map to an economic cost function that associates each
                   discrete control action with its utilization cost.
                   Additionally, we develop a nonlinear battery model to
                   capture fast battery dynamics including the rate
                   capacity effect and we identify its parameters with a
                   nonlinear LS method. We demonstrate the usefulness of
                   the approach by presenting a model predictive control
                   (MPC) scheme for a peak shave application in which we
                   use a linearized version of the battery model along

                   high-fidelity lithium ion electrochemical battery
                   model to simulate a real battery system and we show
                   that the MPC scheme increases the battery lifetime by
                   a factor of 2.6 and the internal rate of return by 11

                   of power transmission systems, a layering of primary,
                   secondary, and tertiary control has become the
                   standard operation paradigm for islanded microgrids.
                   Despite this superficial similarity, the control
                   objectives in microgrids across these three layers
                   are varied and ambitious, and they must be achieved
                   while allowing for robust plug-and-play operation and
                   maximal flexibility, without hierarchical decision
                   making and time-scale separations. In this work, we
                   explore control strategies for these three layers and
                   illuminate some possibly-unexpected connections and
                   dependencies among them. Building from a
                   first-principle analysis of decentralized primary
                   droop control, we study centralized, decentralized,
                   and distributed architectures for secondary frequency
                   regulation. We find that averaging-based distributed
                   controllers using communication among the generation
                   units offer the best combination of flexibility and
                   performance. We further leverage these results to
                   study constrained AC economic dispatch in a tertiary
                   control layer. Surprisingly, we show that the
                   minimizers of the economic dispatch problem are in
                   one-to-one correspondence with the set of
                   steady-states reachable by droop control. In other
                   words, the adoption of droop control is necessary and
                   sufficient to achieve economic optimization. This

                   grid technology, we study the operation of DC/AC
                   inverters in an inductive microgrid. We show that a
                   network of loads and DC/AC inverters equipped with
                   power-frequency droop controllers can be cast as a
                   Kuramoto model of phase-coupled oscillators. This
                   novel description, together with results from the
                   theory of coupled oscillators, allows us to
                   characterize the behavior of the network of inverters
                   and loads. Specifically, we provide a necessary and
                   sufficient condition for the existence of a
                   synchronized solution that is unique and locally
                   exponentially stable. We present a selection of
                   controller gains leading to a desirable sharing of
                   power among the inverters, and specify the set of
                   loads which can be serviced without violating given
                   actuation constraints. Moreover, we propose a
                   distributed integral controller based on averaging
                   algorithms, which dynamically regulates the system
                   frequency in the presence of a time-varying load.
                   Remarkably, this distributed-averaging integral
                   controller has the additional property that it
                   preserves the power sharing properties of the primary
                   droop controller. Our results hold for any acyclic
                   network topology, and hold without assumptions on

                   seekers and trackers uses pattern recognition
                   algorithms to find and keep a lock on an aircraft in
                   the presence of decoy flares. These algorithms
                   identify targets, based on the features of the
                   various objects in the missile's field of view.
                   Because modern both aircrafts and missiles fly faster
                   than sound, speed of operation of the target
                   identifier is critical. In this article, we propose a
                   target recognition system that respects this time
                   constraint. It is based on an artificial neural
                   network implemented in hardware, as a set of parallel
                   processors on a commercially available silicon chip
                   called a ZISC, for Zero Instruction Set Computer.
                   This chip would be integrated in the infrared missile
                   seeker and tracker. We describe the characteristics
                   of the images that the image processing module of
                   this seeker and tracker extracts from the infrared
                   video frames and show how to construct from these
                   translation and rotation invariant features that can
                   be used as input to the neural network. We determine
                   the individual discriminating power of these features
                   by constructing their histograms, which allows us to
                   eliminate some as not being useful for our purpose.
                   Finally, by testing our system on real data, we show
                   that it has a 90 {\%} success rate in aircraft-flare
                   identification, and a processing time that during
                   this time, the aircrafts and missiles will have
                   traveled only a few millimetres. Most of the images

  abstract =      {A cooperative distributed secondary/primary control
                   paradigm for AC microgrids is proposed. This solution
                   replaces the centralized secondary control and the
                   primary-level droop mechanism of each inverter with
                   three separate regulators: voltage, reactive power,
                   and active power regulators. A sparse communication
                   network is spanned across the microgrid to facilitate
                   limited data exchange among inverter controllers.
                   Each controller processes its local and neighbors'
                   information to update its voltage magnitude and
                   frequency (or, equivalently, phase angle) set points.
                   A voltage estimator finds the average voltage across
                   the microgrid, which is then compared to the rated
                   voltage to produce the first voltage correction term.
                   The reactive power regulator at each inverter
                   compares its normalized reactive power with those of
                   its neighbors, and the difference is fed to a
                   subsequent PI controller that generates the second
                   voltage correction term. The controller adds the
                   voltage correction terms to the microgrid rated
                   voltage (provided by the tertiary control) to
                   generate the local voltage magnitude set point. The
                   voltage regulators collectively adjust the average
                   voltage of the microgrid at the rated voltage. The
                   voltage regulators allow different set points for
                   different bus voltages and, thus, account for the
                   line impedance effects. Moreover, the reactive power
                   regulators adjust the voltage to achieve proportional
                   reactive load sharing. The third module, the active
                   power regulator, compares the local normalized active
                   power of each inverter with its neighbors' and uses
                   the difference to update the frequency and,
                   accordingly, the phase angle of that inverter. The
                   global dynamic model of the microgrid, including
                   distribution grid, regulator modules, and the
                   communication network, is derived, and controller
                   design guidelines are provided. Steady-state
                   performance analysis shows that the proposed
                   controller can accurately handle the global voltage
                   regulation and - roportional load sharing. An AC
                   microgrid prototype is set up, where the controller
                   performance, plug-and-play capability, and resiliency
                   to the failure in the communication links are

                   problem. The main properties of the proposed

                   local controllers of DGs that use only local

                   of extending the notion of (strict) dissipativity for
                   periodic systems. We prove that optimal
                   {\$}P{\$}-periodic operation and MPC stability
                   directly follow, similarly to the steady-state case,
                   which can be seen as a special case of the proposed
                   framework. Finally, we illustrate the theoretical
                   results with several simple examples.},

                   when a persistent disturbance is present in the model

                   the use of disturbances in the prediction model.
                   Robust stability and feasibility are established
                   under the assumption that the disturbance change

  abstract =      {In this paper, the stability of parallel-operated
                   inverters in the sense of boundedness is
                   investigated. At first, the non-linear model of
                   parallelled inverters with a generic linear or
                   non-linear load is obtained by using the generalised
                   dissipative Hamiltonian structure and then the robust
                   droop controller, recently proposed in the literature
                   for parallel operation of inverters, is implemented
                   in a way to produce a bounded control output. The
                   proposed controller is called the bounded droop
                   controller (BDC). It introduces a zero-gain property
                   and can guarantee the boundedness of the closed-loop
                   system solution. Therefore, for the first time, the
                   closed-loop stability in the sense of boundedness is
                   guaranteed for parallelled inverters feeding generic
                   non-linear/linear loads. The controller structure is
                   further improved to increase its robustness with
                   respect to initial conditions, numerical errors or
                   external disturbances while maintaining the stability
                   property. Moreover, the controller is tuned to avoid
                   any possible limit cycles in the voltage dynamics.
                   Real-time simulation results for two single-phase
                   inverters operated in parallel loaded with a
                   non-linear load are presented to verify the
                   effectiveness of the proposed BDC.},

  abstract =      {A generalized nonlinear control scheme suitable to
                   regulate any state variable at any desired reference
                   value, for a class of nonlinear Hamiltonian-passive
                   systems that includes switching power devices, is
                   presented. The proposed controller acts as a special
                   nonlinear oscillator, uses as feedback only the state
                   variable that has to be regulated, renders the
                   Hamiltonian- passive structure of the entire system,
                   and regulates the nonlinear system to any nonzero
                   desired equilibrium independently from its parameters
                   and characteristics. Particularly, it is proven that
                   under some common assumptions, the system states
                   consisting of the controller states plus the original
                   system states, are bounded for constant or piecewise
                   constant external inputs. Under the same assumptions,
                   it is established and proven that for these sys- tems
                   there exists a general, bounded, differentiable,
                   nonincreas- ing storage function. Thus, LaSalle's
                   invariance principle can be directly applied to prove
                   convergence to the desired equilibrium. Although this
                   storage function can be really constructed as a
                   suitably switching function, its explicit derivation
                   is not necessary for the controller design; it is
                   only needed to guess that such a storage function
                   exists. This constitutes the main contribution of
                   this brief since, in order to implement the proposed
                   controller, one has simply to check whether some
                   initial assumptions are satisfied. The simulation and
                   experimental results conducted for the case of a
                   dc–dc boost converter system with resistance–
                   inductance load verify the proposed design approach.},

                   which was recently used in several results on
                   economic model predictive control to ensure optimal
                   operation of a system at steady-state as well as
                   stability. In particular, we first investigate
                   whether this dissipativity property is not only
                   sufficient, but also necessary for optimal
                   steady-state operation. In the most general case,
                   this is not true; nevertheless, under an additional
                   controllability assumption, we show that
                   dissipativity is in fact necessary. Second, we
                   provide a robustness analysis of the dissipativity
                   property with respect to changes in the constraint
                   set, which can result in a change in the considered
